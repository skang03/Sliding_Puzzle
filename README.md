# Sliding Puzzle for CS 301: Software Development

The overall design and interfaces were made by Peter Kemper, a Computer Science professor at the College of William & Mary, to be used in class. 

I had to make the game work such that one can run the program and play the game. The code I wrote is located in /src/edu/wm/cs/cs301/slidingpuzzle/SimplePuzzleState.java.
